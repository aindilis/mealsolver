# incorporate recipes
# use official sources for daily nutrient requirements
# use official sources for food-nutrient database
# incorporate units
#  * minimum units, i.e. foods/ingredients should be treated as having
#    finite granularity; can't arbitrarily subdivide, ex. you might include
#    half a grapefruit in a recipe but nobody's doing 0.3423232344 of a grapefruit
